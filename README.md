# Spotify web clone in React js

In Hacktober Fest 2020, the community contributed in the Spotify app clone in flutter, so to cover the web platform as well, this year we have added the Spotify web clone project whose UI is also as awesome. Enjoy!

##### Read the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/clubgamma/spotify-web-clone/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for all about how to start contributing to the project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm run build`

(won't require)
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

#### `npm run test`

By using this command you can run tests , which will test different component and features .
testing means that you test individual parts (units) of your software. You do that by defining results that your code should produce for certain input values and verify whether they occur.
There are a lot of reasons why it is useful to write unit tests, the most obvious being:
* you can find and fix bugs before they occur.
* you automatically think about edge cases in your code more often.
* it gets tremendously easier to work together with other developers or to hand over the project to someone else.
